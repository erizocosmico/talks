* About Go

- compiled
- statically and strongly typed
- garbage collected
- created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson on 2007 at Google
- Announced on 2009
- 1.0 version released on 2012

* Goals of Go

- Be memory safe
- Easy multithreaded and concurrent programming
- Blazing fast compilation
- Avoid a verbose type system (Java, C++, ...)
- Easy dependency management
- Everyone that knows Go should read and understand a Go codebase

* Hello world

.play code/hello.go

* Hello world on the web

.play code/hellonet.go

* Basic types

.code code/types.go /^var/,/^\)/

* Our own types

We can make our own named types.

  type MyInt int

* Arrays and slices

.code code/arrays.go

* Differences between arrays and slices

- An array has a fixed length
- A slice can grow automatically as you append elements
- Passing an array to a function copies all the elements
- Passing a slice to a function does not

As a result of this, arrays are rarely used in Go. Slices are used instead because of their flexibility.

* Maps

A map is a structure that defines a relationship between a key and a value.

.code code/maps.go

* Pointers

Yes, you heard well. Go has pointers. üò±
But fear not! üí™

.play code/pointers.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Control structures

- if
- for
- switch
- select (we won't see that now, though)

* if statement

Notice that there are no parens! üéâ

.play code/if.go /^func main/,/^}/

* if statement

If allows an initialization statement.

.code code/if_init.go /^func main/,/^}/

* for loop

Go has just one type of loop. No foreach, no while, no nothing else.

As the Golang team says:

  Do less, enable more.

* for loop

The old-school for loop we all know and love.

.play code/for.go /^func main/,/^}/

* for loop

The while for loop.

.play code/for_while.go /^func main/,/^}/

* for loop

Infinite loop. We're not running this one.

.code code/for_infinite.go /^func main/,/^}/

* for loop

This kind of for each, loops over iterable values: slices, arrays, channels, and maps.

.play code/for_range.go /^func main/,/^}/

* switch

We all know switch.

.play code/switch.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Functions

.play code/funcs1.go

* Functions

Functions can receive an unspecified number of arguments.

  func Foo(a int, b ...string)

Functions can return more than one element.

  func Foo() (int, string, Foo)

* Functions are first class values

.play code/funcs3.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Functions have their type

  type StringHasher func(string) int64

* Structs

Does Go have classes? Nope. But it does have structs.

.code code/structs.go

* Structs

.play code/structs_init.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Structs

.play code/structs_ptr.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Struct composition

As we don't have classes, we can't have subclasses. But fear not! Composition comes to the rescue!

.code code/struct_comp.go

* Struct composition

.play code/struct_comp2.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Public, private, protected, ...

As you must have noticed, there is no private or protected or public. Go has a clever trick for this.

- Everything that starts with an uppercase letter is public outside it's package.
- Everything that stats with a lowercase letter is private outside it's package.
- Everything is visible from inside the package.

  type myPrivateType int64
  type MyPublicType int64


Again, do less, enable more.

* Interfaces

A powerful tool for abstraction. Remember the "implements" keyword from languages like Java? Then forget about it. In Go, types implement the interfaces implicitly.

.code code/interfaces.go

* Interfaces

.play code/interfaces2.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Interfaces

Interfaces can also be composed.

.code code/interface_comp.go

* The error model

Go does not have exceptions. It has panics, but that is not the way you check errors. Panics should not happen. Instead, functions return errors you need to check.

.play code/errors.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Panics and recoveries

.play code/panic.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Panics and recoveries

.play code/recover.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Concurrency

Go has two built-in things for concurrency.

- Channels
- Goroutines

* Goroutines

A Goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution. There can be multiple goroutines in one actual OS thread.

* Goroutines

Let's imagine we have an expensive computation like calculating `n+1`.

.code code/goro1.go /^func plusOne/,/^}/
.play code/goro1.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Goroutines

Now, how do we make it parallel? using the keyword `go`.

.play code/goro2.go /^func main/,/^}/

But the program exits before the goroutines are executed.

* Goroutines

How can we fix it?

- channels
- `sync.WaitGroup`
- etc

* Goroutines

Purrfect üëç

.play code/goro3.go /^func main/,/^}/

Note that they are not in order!

* Channels

A channel is like a tube where you can send an receive things from. You receive the things in the same order you sent them and only once in a synchronous way.

You can create a channel with `make`.

  var myChan = make(chan int)

You can also give a buffer to channels (how many items accept until block).

  var myBufferedChan = make(chan int, 2)

* Channels

- Send and receive operations are blocking. You can't send until someone is reading and you can't receive until someone sends something.
- Nil channels block forever.
- Sending on a closed channel causes a panic.

* Channels

Let's see some action.

.code code/chans1.go

But that does NOT work. As I said, sending needs someone reading, so it will block forever.

* Channels

Now it works.

.play code/chans2.go /^func main/,/^}/
